# Face-mesh-detection
 This code is an example of face mesh detection using the MediaPipe library. MediaPipe is a popular library for building applications with machine learning components, and in this case, it's being used for facial landmark detection. Facial landmarks are specific points on the face, such as the corners of the eyes, nose, and mouth.
